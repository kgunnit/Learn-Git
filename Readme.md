This is me making sure I understand Github.

Creating a default document in master, and then modify it in a branch, then merge back to master.

Adding a line up here to understand git merges and conflicts.

I think I understand this, at least via making file changes within the web browser.

Made some commits and changes via cmd as well.

Added a file to the repo.

Adding a few lines
at the end of Readme to understand conflicts and merges.

Is this something else I can add?
