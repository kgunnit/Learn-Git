# Understanding Git

This is me making sure I understand Github.

Creating a default document in master, and then modify it in a branch, then merge back to master.

I think I understand this, at least via making file changes within the web browser.

Made some commits and changes via cmd as well.

Added a file to the repo.

Adding a few lines
at the end of Readme to understand conflicts and merges.

## Things to Remember
    List
        - Clone to create local repo (this will automatically create a local dir, so no need to)
        - Don't forget to change branches
            - git branch <new-branch-name>
            - git checkout <branch-name>
        - Do a pull before pushing a commit to make sure there are no changes
